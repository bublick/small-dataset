            <h2>Meet the Team Behind RumX</h2>

            <div class="col-sm">
                <p class="text-block">RumX didn't just happen overnight; it's the result of years of dedication and a genuine passion for rum. Originating in Germany's bustling rum scene in 2018 as <b>Rum Tasting Notes</b>, the platform took a new identity as <b>RumX</b> in 2021 to better reflect its expanded capabilities. Here's a little about the core team that makes it all possible:</p>

                <p class="text-block"><b>Oliver Gerhardt</b> laid the groundwork for RumX back in 2018 when it was just a side project known as Rum Tasting Notes. Today, he's our full-time tech wizard, responsible for both iOS and Android app development, as well as keeping the RumX website up to par.</p>
            
                <p class="text-block"><b>Jakob Schellhorn</b> joined the inner circle in early 2021, overseeing product management and marketing. Although a part-time contributor, Jakob injects vital expertise in Customer Experience and Growth, helping to steer the RumX ship.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="pt-5">                
            <p class="text-block">In addition to this core team, we receive exceptional support from various freelancers who help us make RumX what it is today. Special mention goes to <b>Marcus Rottschäfer</b>, who develops the recommendation algorithms through his excellent machine learning skills, which are used for instance to determine personalized recommendations or rums that taste similar.</p>
            <p class="text-block">Furthermore, we would like to thank <a class="main-link" href="https://www.theresaplos.com">Theresa Plos</a> for the major redesign. She revamped the look of the app, the website and the logo in Summer 2022 and gave RumX a new face.</p>
            <p class="text-block">Special thanks also go to <b>Benoit Bail-Danel</b>, who accompanied <i>Rum Tasting Notes</i> from October 2019 to January 2021. Together with Oliver, he took part in the <a class="main-link" href="https://sandbox-stuttgart.de">start-up accelerator programme Sandbox</a> at the Stuttgart Media University and has helped to significantly expand the partner ecosystem and user base through his valuable network.</p>
            <p class="text-block">A special thanks also goes to <b>Vincent Kesel</b>, who has played a major role in the development of the long-awaited Android version of <i>Rum Tasting Notes</i> in the summer of 2020.</p>

            <p class="text-block">Whether full-time, part-time, or freelance, every team member contributes uniquely to making RumX the ultimate platform for rum enthusiasts. We invite you to become part of our community and experience RumX for yourself.</p>
